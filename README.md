## Hardware Description

Microchipâ€™s RN2483 (RN2903) Low-Power Long Range LoRa
Technology Transceiver module provides an easy to
use, low-power solution for long range wireless data
transmission.

The RN2483 module complies with the LoRaWAN
Class A protocol specifications. It integrates RF, a
baseband controller, command Application
Programming Interface (API) processor, making it a
complete long range Solution.

The RN2483 (RN2903) module is suitable for simple long range
sensor applications with external host MCU.
